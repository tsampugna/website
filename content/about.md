# Hi there

My name is Tony and I'm the author of this simple blog. I made it to document and present cool ideas.

When I'm not designing, implementing, and maintaining secure and efficient network infrastructures, supporting virtualization and cloud networking, and contributing to ensure data protection, disaster recovery, and business continuity, I'm learning anything that interests me.
